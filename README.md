# Image Classification with mmpretrain

**Overview**  
This repository contains code for training an image classification model using mmpretrain, with a focus on familiarizing oneself with openmmlab projects and the associated tech stack. The primary learning outcomes was getting comfortable with training computer vision deep learning models using openmmlab projects and understanding the structure of these projects.

**Prerequisites**  
Familiarity with Linux environments.
Basic understanding of deep learning concepts.
Access to a suitable environment for training (Google Colab, personal GPU-enabled machine, EC2, etc.).

**Task Summary**  
*Task 1: Dataset Preparation*  
Download the Oxford Flowers dataset.  
Prepare the dataset in the SubFolder format compatible with mmpretrain structure. 

*Task 2: Environment Setup*  
Set up mmpretrain in your chosen environment.  
Verify the installation to ensure a working environment.  

*Task 3: Config File Structure*  
Understand the structure of config files used by mmpretrain.  
Ensure comprehension of config file components.  

*Task 4: Model Training*  
Select two models from mmpretrain.  
Train the selected models for image classification using the prepared dataset.  

*Task 5: Model Evaluation*  
Evaluate trained models using suitable metrics (e.g., overall accuracy, F1 score, visual comparisons).  

*Task 6: Lessons Learned*  
Summarize challenges faced, solutions implemented, lessons learned, and additional thoughts regarding the assignment.
